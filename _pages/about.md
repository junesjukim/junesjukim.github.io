I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

As an <strong>engineer</strong> and <strong>researcher</strong>, I explore:
* Robotic Learning: Investigating novel methods like Flow-Matching for intelligent agent control.
* Robotic Perception: Fusing sensor data like LiDAR and Depth Cameras for robust autonomous navigation.
* On-device & Edge AI: Building efficient, real-world models for applications in accessibility and retail.

Currently, I am a <strong>research assistant</strong> at SNU's RLLAB and a <strong>software engineer</strong> at 2nd Company, where I build accessibility tools for the visually impaired.

I am an <strong>undergraduate student</strong> at Seoul National University, majoring in Biosystems Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. My academic diligence has been recognized through scholarships such as the <strong>Dongwon Development Fund Scholarship</strong> and the <strong>SNU Academic Scholarship</strong>.
