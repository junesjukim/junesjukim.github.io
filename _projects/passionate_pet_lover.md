This project was developed between **October 2023 and April 2024**.

As the **Founder & CEO**, I led the development of a daily pet-care management platform.

### Key Features & Achievements:
- Developed a platform for daily pet care management based on the owner's time and money budget.
- Implemented personalized recommendations for commerce and IoT pet care products to enable data-driven healthcare for pets.
- Won a venture forum competition, which led to being selected as Korea's representative for the 2024 Alliance Student Venture Forum. This was achieved by identifying and targeting a niche yet high-growth market.
