This project was conducted at **SNU Biosystem Control and Precision Lab** from **August 2022 to December 2022**.

As the **Team Leader**, I led the development of an autonomous driving robot.

### Key Features & Achievements:
- Developed a YOLOv5 application on a Depth Camera, fused with LiDAR data for robust autonomous driving.
- Conducted educational sessions on basic Computer Vision, Ubuntu, ROS, LiDAR, and Odometry.
- Ran practice sessions covering the implementation of basic YOLOv1 to transfer-learning YOLOv5 for Depth Cameras.
- Won the **Best Lap Time award** in the Autonomous Driving Robot Race, a competitive event with multiple cars and obstacles.
