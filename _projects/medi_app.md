This is an ongoing project at **2nd Company**, started in **September 2024**.

As the **Lead Software Engineer**, I am developing MEDi, an application designed to help visually-impaired shoppers identify medication packages using their phone camera.

The app aims to improve accessibility and independence for users by providing real-time audio feedback on medication details.
