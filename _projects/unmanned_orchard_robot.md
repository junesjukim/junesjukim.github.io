This project was conducted at **SNU Biosystems Control & Precision Lab** from **June 2022 to September 2022**.

As a **Machine-Learning Engineer**, I worked on applying vision sensors for an unmanned orchard robot.

### Key Features & Achievements:
- Developed a YOLOv5 implementation for fruit disease classification.
- Implemented tree detection using SLAM-based odometry information.
- Gained practical experience with odometry algorithms using NVIDIA TurtleBot, ROS1, and Ubuntu 18.04.
- Won the **Grand Prize** at the Agricultural Robot Competition commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Rural Development Administration of Korea.
- Participated in the Fall Agricultural Machinery Conference.
